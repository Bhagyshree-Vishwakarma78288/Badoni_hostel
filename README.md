Badoni_Hostel_Building
Worked on the structural design and detailing for the Badoni Hostel building, a G+2 structure with a terrace. The project involved comprehensive drafting of all structural elements, including beams, columns, slabs, foundations, mummty (roof) stairs, and other essential components, ensuring safety, stability, and compliance with engineering standards.

Key Contributions:

Designed and detailed beams, columns, slabs, foundations, and mummty stairs to ensure strength and stability.
Performed load calculations and reinforcement planning, adhering to standard engineering practices.
Designed the staircase and terrace for accessibility and compliance with safety norms.
Used AutoCAD to create precise 2D drawings and structural layouts.
Coordinated with architectural teams to balance functionality, aesthetics, and engineering requirements.
This project strengthened my expertise in hostel building construction, focusing on structural integrity, safety, and space efficiency.
